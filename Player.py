# This file is intended to be a final submission. python tester.py Player.py
# should work at all times. If it does not, there is a bug.
# If you're just trying to test a solution, scroll down to the Player
# class.

# This file is intended to be in the same format as a valid solution, so
# that users can edit their solution into Player and then submit just this
# file to the contest. If you see any reason this would not work, please submit
# an Issue to https://github.com/ChadAMiller/hungergames/issues or email me.
